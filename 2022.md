* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria]] I had to think about how humans destroy coral reafs and how it must have felt to find out that corals and anomones are more closely related to humans than to plants... Then I had to think about how in the greek mythology the old goods were killed by the new goods and how this is somehow happening now with the new gods being humans and the old one corals, megafauna (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafauna#Megafaunal_mass_extinctions] and biodiversity in general. Then I thought about how we killed other old gods being other species of homo and how we might be killed by a new species (of homo?) the roboters. Then I thought a plot were the robots end up exterminating (human) life and who would kill them or what they would bring forth. Maybe organic life again just out of intrest which could then again evolve (faster?) create something human like and again kill their gods :)
